I was an undergraduate student from University of Maryland  <img src="/images/terp.png" width="60"> (**Go Terps!**). I double majored in Astronomy and Physics and graduated in December 2020 with High Honor in Astronomy.

My ultimate research goal is to utilize the combination of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning to enhance human life quality. I am currently advised by Professor [Zhaoyang Wang](http://engineering.catholic.edu/research-and-faculty/faculty-profiles/mechanical/wang-zhaoyang/index.html) in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am looking for opportunities to pursue computer science in a graduate degree.
