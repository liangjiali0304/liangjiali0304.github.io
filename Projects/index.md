I came up with this idea when I tried to review GRE vocab in the preparation for the GRE test. I found using excel on the computer was complicated and using an App on the phone sometimes very distracting. Therefore, I wanted to write a simple program that can combine the functions of recording new vocabs and reviewing the saved vocabs.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
### Function 1 : Save new Vocab
<img align="Right" width="310" img src="/Projects/assets/images/Vocab_App3.png" >{:style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;"}
- 單詞 = Input your new vocab
- 詞性 = Part of speech
- 翻譯 = Translation and definition

The vocabs are saved to both a txt file and an excel file for later quick references.

<br/>
### Function 2 : Review vocabs

The review function randomly selects vocabs stored in the ".txt" file. I use the plus sign ("+") to resemble a word's difficulty level of rememberability.
For example, "+" is a bit hard to recite, "++" is like umm, I forget this again, "+++" is like I swear I have seen this word, and "++++" is definitely the hardest to remember. You can remove the "+" inside the ".txt" file using search (Win: Ctrl + F / Mac: Cmd + F).

When you review a word, and forget its meaning, and hit "Mark", the app will add a "+" at the end of the word. When you open/close the app, the code would convert the ".txt" file to an excel file. And Vocabs with different numbers of "+" show up in different colors in the excel file (Shown in the picture below).

Here is a sample excel file. I find it very helpful when I go out and review vocab over excel on the phone. You can also only review the marked vocab by clicking the "Review only Marked" button.
