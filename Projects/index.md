I came up with this idea when I tried to review GRE vocab in the preparation for GRE test. I found using excel on the computer was complicated and using an App on the phone sometimes very distracting. Therefore, I wanted to write a simple program that can combine the functions of recording new vocabs and reviewing the saved vocabs.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
### Save new Vocab

- 單詞 = Input your new vocab
- 詞性 = Part of speech
- 翻譯 = Translation and definition

The vocabs are saved to both a txt file and an excel file for later quick references.

### Review vocabs

I use plus sign ("+") to resemble the difficulty level of a word.
For example, "+" is a bit hard, "++" is like umm, I forget this again, "+++" is like I swear I have seen this word, and "++++" is definitely the hardest. You can remove the mark in the ".txt" file.

When you review a word, and forget its meaning, and hit "Mark", the app will add a "+" at the end of the word. When you open/close the app, the code would convert the ".txt" file to an excel file. And Vocabs with different number of "+" show up in different colors in the excel file (Shown in the picture below).

Here is a sample excel file. I find it very helpful when I go out and review vocab over excel on the phone.
