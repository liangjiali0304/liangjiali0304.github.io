I was an SAT Math Teacher at [New Oriental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Oriental) in Shanghai. New Oriental is one of the biggest and leading education organizations in China. I oversaw over 100 students and offered them mock tests, leading to an average of 10% increase in their test scores.

Teaching is fun and yet making friends with my students is even more satisfying. I found out incorporating friendship into their learning process greatly help them grow, learn, and achieve better scores. Some of my students went to prominent universities such as Emory University, Ohio State University, University of Connecticut, University of Toronto and etc.
